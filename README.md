# üõ†Ô∏è Clinton Neovim Configuration

A modern, minimal, and fast Neovim setup powered by **Lazy.nvim**. This config is optimized for web development, LSP support, terminal workflows, and smooth navigation.

My use of Neovim is very minimalist and very focused on defaults. I also forbid myself to fumble around split screens and tabs.

**Disclaimer: Fork this if you want to use it. I constantly improve my configuration over time so this repo will change slightly.**

## My workflow
### Few new bindings
I want to have to remember only a few bindings. I'm not interested in re-learning 100 bindings. If I can't list the bindings one by one it's probably too many.

### No split screens
I use the floating terminal instead of split screen. When I need two screens I open Neovim in a second monitor. I hate split screens with a passion and find that it overcomplicates my workflow to have to remember how to switch between editor screens when I already by habit switch between monitors and windows with my Hyperland setup.

Hitting <leader>t to open a floating terminal, do what I need there, then :q is perfect and doesn't get in the way.

### No tabs
I switch between buffers instead of tabs (and close buffers when I no longer need them open). More than 3 buffers is usually too much.

### No themes or fancy stuff
Vim already has a bunch of native themes so there's no need to pack in a bunch of extra plugins and heavy downloads.

### Vim fundie
I try to stay very Vim original and not update key bindings for motions.

I want to keep my Neovim setup working for me but also want to preserve the skill to open vi in a remote terminal without my config and not be completely lost.

This is why I try to stay as Vim fundie as possible. Every new change is a new habit I need to learn and I try to avoid needing to reprogram my habits.

### Plugins that save time
I'm ok with plugins as long as they bring large productivity gains. You can see the plugins I use below. If I use a plugin it's because it's almost impossible to live without it.
